So, I'm trying this blog thing out for the first time.
Excited to see how this goes.
I plan to post about my projects and whatever else I find interesting.
Especially about C++.

As an introduction, I'm nobody important.
I'm not a professional programmer (yet),
just a hobbyist and lover of open-source.
My name is Isaiah.

I started teaching myself C++ in high school
and haven't stopped learning since.

That's all I'll say for now. Hopefully, this goes well.
